# ml-coupon-acceptance
The survey data describes different driving scenarios and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. There are three possible answers - “Right away”, “Later, before the coupon expires”, “No, I do not want the coupon”. Create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon.
